# capacoa-artsdata-usermeta

This is a Wordpress plugin that adds additional fields to the WP REST User API so CAPACOA member organizations can be uploaded to Artsdata.

This plugin is for CAPACOA only.

Here is an example call to get a list of 50 users:

`GET /wp-json/wp/v2/users?per_page=50`

The data can be automatcially refreshed using Artsdata admin buttons available on [this page](https://capacoa.ca/en/artsdata-admin/).
